# Cholesterol-Seaborn-Visualization
The following repository contains data from a fictitious exercise conducted during the "Biological Data Analysis with Python" course at the University of San Jorge.

Fictitious data file named patients.csv was generated, containing the data for "ID", "Sex", "Age", "Weight", "Height", "BMI", "BMI-CAT", "Does the patient has obesity?", Does the patient have diabetes?", "Blood glucose level", "Blood cholesterol level", "Blood triglyceride level", "insa gene expression", "slc2a2 gene expression", "pepck gene expression", "fto gene expression", "mc4r gene expression", and "fads1 gene expression".

The program allows you to:
1. Generate a countplot that divides patients based on their BMI-CAT
2. Generate a histogram to divide patients with diabetes based on their age.
3. Generate a cluster plot to divide obese patients based on their sex.
4. Generate a bar plot to relate people with diabetes and those with obesity.
5. Generate 2 subplots that relate triglyceride and cholesterol levels with obesity.
6. Generate 3 subplots that relate triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose levels with diabetes.
7. Generate 6 subplots with boxplots that relate the expression of the 6 genes in obese patients.
8. Generate 6 subplots with boxplots that relate the expression of the 6 genes in diabetic patients.
9. Generate a heat map that correlates the genes insa, slc2a2, and pepck.
10. Generate a heat map that correlates the genes fto, mc4r, and fads1.
11. Generate a cluster map that correlates the expression of the 6 genes
